This JavaScript code controls an image slider with next and previous buttons and slide number indicators. It dynamically generates pagination buttons based on the number of images and allows users to click on them to navigate the slider. The code also manages the active state of the current slide, updates slide numbers, and disables the next and previous buttons appropriately at the beginning and end of the slider.
